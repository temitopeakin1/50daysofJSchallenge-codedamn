// Rna Transcription
// Instructions
// Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

// Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

// The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

// The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

// Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

// G -> C
// C -> G
// T -> A
// A -> U


const transcription = (dna) => {
	// code here
    let rna = ''
   for(let i=0; i<dna.length; i++) { 
        if(dna[i] === 'G') rna +='C'
        if(dna[i] === 'C') rna +='G'
        if(dna[i] === 'T') rna +='A'
        if(dna[i] === 'A') rna +='U'
   }
   return rna
